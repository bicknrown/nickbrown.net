professionally, i am a computer science PhD. student at the [university at buffalo](https://cse.buffalo.edu) doing systems research on database query compiler optimization, building declarative compilers, and live program analysis.  

outside of that, you may find me working on or studying just about anything that piques my interest. in no particular order this includes, but is not limited to:
- amateur radio
- hobbyist electronics
- vintage test equipment
- retro computing
- home automation
- systems administration
- carpentry
- combustion engines
- synthetic and organic chemistry
- biological protein expression
- optical physics
- photography
- crocheting
- ceramics

and probably a whole lot more.  

my goal with this website is to document as much as i can for both my record keeping, and hopefully for others to find either enjoyment or utility out of the information.  

if you have questions or comments, feel free to contact me by email.
