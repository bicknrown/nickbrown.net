## what is it for?

this site is [my](/nick/) corner of the internet to put things i find interesting, and things i am currently working on and want to share.  

## what is it made out of?

this site was made using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), and a heavily modified version of the template [hugo-classic](https://github.com/goodroot/hugo-classic), which in turn is based on [hugo-xmin](https://github.com/yihui/hugo-xmin), and nginx is used for serving the site. you may find the source code [here](https://github.com/bicknrown/nickbrown.net).  

my goal was to create a lightweight, accessible, and good looking site, and this dictated style choices.  

### fonts

- titles and headers are [Montserrat](https://github.com/JulietaUla/Montserrat/)
- header and body text are [Zilla Slab](https://github.com/mozilla/zilla-slab/)
- code block text is [Liberation Mono](https://github.com/liberationfonts/liberation-fonts)

### code highlighting

- light mode is [modus-operandi](https://github.com/protesilaos/modus-themes)
- dark mode is [modus-vivendi](https://github.com/protesilaos/modus-themes)

### there's a [dark/light] mode?

yes, that is controlled [automagically through css in your browser](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-color-scheme).
